# Noise Detection in Images

## Overview

Detecting the type of noise present in an image is crucial for various image analysis tasks. This repository contains a model for classifying and identifying common types of noise in images, such as Salt and Pepper, Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, and Random noise.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Data Collection**: To create a dataset for training and testing the noise detection model, a set of images was obtained. These images were then introduced to five distinct types of noise, which can disrupt image analysis.

2. **Noise Application**: The following types of noise were applied to the images:
   - Salt and Pepper Noise
   - Gaussian Noise
   - Speckle Noise
   - Poisson Noise
   - Random Noise

   The noisy images were saved and made available for download.

3. **Model Development**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was designed and implemented for the purpose of classifying the different types of noise present in the images.

4. **Training**: The model was trained using the dataset of images with distinct types of noise. The model learned to identify and classify each type of noise.

5. **Prediction**: The trained model can be used to predict the type of noise present in new images. It can be a valuable tool for image processing and analysis.

This repository serves as a resource for noise detection in images, helping users understand and implement a model for identifying the type of noise that may disrupt their image analysis tasks.

Please feel free to explore the code and data in this repository to better understand how noise detection in images can be achieved.
